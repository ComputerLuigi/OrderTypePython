A program to deterime the order types of triples of points on a plane. 
0 - points are colinear
1 - points form a right handed triangle 
-1 - points form a left hande triangle

To use call $: python ReadInput.py
this will read input from input1 and input2 files, compute the order types
and compare the results. If two sets of coordinates are ordertype equivalent 
then they are 'the same ignoring small pertubations'.
